This is a proxy implementation of the paper [SummaRuNNer](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.04230.pdf)
The code contains only the content and salience term in the cost function, 
and embeddings were trained with model instead of using a pretrained.

In the code:
* sent model = word model in the original paper
* paragraph model = sent model in the original paper
